A group of interested citizens and seniors formed the initial committee and began gathering support and ideas on how to raise funds to build a new building that would be used for the needs of the adult population living in the south half of Adams County including Berne Geneva Linn Grove and Monroe. Neighboring Wells County was in the process of receiving a Federal Grant of the Housing and Urban Development and after receiving further encouragement from local citizens the newly formed South Adams Seniors Inc. decided to apply for a grant. With cooperation from the City of Berne a $445000 Community Focus Fund Grant was received from the State of Indiana. Local citizens responded and well over $200000 additional money was raised to furnish the building with tables chairs and other startup expenses.,,Assistance to the Homebound; Choice - at Home Assistance; Home Delivered Meals; Homemaker - assistant to homebound; Information and Referral; Insurance Counseling/Legal Services; Tax Assistance; Council on Aging Van Service; Encouraging of Volunteerism; Assistance with Energy Needs,,Mon - Fri: 8:00 am - 3:00 pm
